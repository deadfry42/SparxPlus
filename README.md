# SparxPlus
A browser extension for SparxLearning web apps to improve QoL (without sacrificing learning!)  
Compatible with [SparxMaths](https://sparxmaths.com).  

> [!WARNING]
> This is not officially supported by Sparx, and can be removed, banned or made dysfunctional whenever.  
> This extension was made in a few days, with no plan to actually maintain in the future, so the code is messy and hard to adapt.
