# SparxPlus
A browser (chrome and firefox, and soon maybe safari?) extension for SparxLearning web apps to improve QoL (without sacrificing learning!)  
Compatible with:
* <img width=14 src="assets/icon/sparx/maths.svg"> [SparxMaths](https://sparxmaths.com).
* More is planned in the future.

> [!WARNING]
> This is not officially supported by Sparx, and can be removed, banned or stop working whenever.  
> Issues you may encounter while using Sparx may be caused by this extension, as it modifies the html page heavily.  
> This is considered an experimental extension.  
>  
> I did not spend time to make this code readable; proceed with caution.  

> [!NOTE]
> This extension is not meant to be used to breeze through your homework. It is simply to help/motivate you.  
> This means that stuff like an autosolver, is not going to be availble in this extension.

This extension is not affiliated with Sparx, otherwise known as [Sparx-Learning](https://sparx-learning.com).
