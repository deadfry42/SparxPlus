> [!WARNING]
> This is not officially supported by Sparx, and can be removed, banned or stop working whenever.  
> Issues you may encounter while using Sparx may be caused by this extension, as it modifies the html page heavily.  
> This is considered an experimental extension.  
>  
> I did not spend time to make this code readable; proceed with caution.  

This extension is not affiliated with Sparx, otherwise known as [Sparx-Learning](https://sparx-learning.com).
